## GitHub Actions & CI/CD

Throughout development, **GitHub** was used for version control, collaboration, and automation. We implemented **GitHub Actions** to enable Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), which provided the following benefits:

- **Automated Builds:** Push and pull requests triggered a build pipeline to ensure the project compiled successfully.  
- **Unit Testing:** Tests were automatically executed on every commit, ensuring new changes did not break existing functionality.  
- **Code Quality Assurance:** GitHub workflows helped maintain a clean and reliable codebase.

This integration streamlined development and ensured consistent quality across the project lifecycle.
